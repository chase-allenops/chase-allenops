### Hi, my name is Chase and I love data, dogs, and fly fishing. 

I am building [Pipelinx.io](https://pipelinx.io/), a data engineering consultancy for businesses of all sizes. Our main objective is to provide data engineering expertise to our clients through our proprietary Data Lab. This Data Lab allows us to connect to and integrate data from almost any platform a business uses, allowing for the quick and accurate compilation of reporting. By unifying data, and managing the pipelines responsible for moving the data, this allows businesses to focus on running the business instead of running exports.

**Fields of interest:** Big Data, Data Pipelines, DevOps, Automation, and Machine Learning
